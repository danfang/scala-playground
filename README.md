# scala-playground

My explorations in Scala, starting with [S-99 Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/).

Goals:
- Learn and master functional programming, currying, & concurrency methodology
- Be comfortable using multiple inheritance, traits, and OOP design patterns (Singleton, Factories) in Scala
- Know when to use mutable and immutable data structures in various scenarios
- Write well tested (TDD + BDD) code
- Be able to design a medium-scale project in Scala

Thoughts:
- Functions are hard, but rewarding
- I have no clue whether my approach is correct or efficient
- ^ Scala provides 100 ways to approach a problem, hard to know which one to use
- So much syntactic sugar!
- Leads to better architecture and structure than with Python
